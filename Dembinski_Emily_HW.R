# Homework Computational Reproducibility I 

#I have never coded before so this entire process has been a lot of learning.
#Through it all I have learned about what GitHub is and have started to familiarize myself with R studio
#I think I am still a little confused about the whole conceptual layout of everything, but I think that will get sorted as I use it more.
#The activity provided a good first experience. 

#Wilson et. al. suggest that tracking changes and collaboration are key tenants of "good enough" practices in scientific computing.
#R and Github help with these suggestions as in combination pushing and pulling R script from Github allows collaboration to occur while keeping track of all the changes.
#This allows other researchers to better understand one's work and keeps things clear for others that are interested.
